<span data-indentlevel="2"></span><span data-tag="begin"><strong>My math
rock band needs lyrics for our concept album about biotechnology. Some
good lyrics for a song entitled "The Sky is Unclassified in Most
Locations" are:</strong></span>
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the lab where secrets grow,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Genes and codes, the future’s show.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Microscopes and petri dreams,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Life’s rewritten, or so it seems.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>The sky is unclassified in most
locations,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Boundless as our DNA’s mutations.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the petri dish to the stars,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Biotech’s reach, it knows no bars.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>CRISPR cuts and splices fate,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Nature’s laws we now debate.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Synthetic cells, a new creation,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Life’s blueprint, our own narration.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the helix, we find our place,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>A dance of genes, a cosmic race.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the smallest cell to the vast
unknown,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Biotech’s seeds are sown.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>The sky is unclassified in most
locations,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Boundless as our DNA’s mutations.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the petri dish to the stars,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Biotech’s reach, it knows no bars.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In every code, a story lies,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Of human dreams and boundless skies.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>The future’s here, in strands and
chains,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Biotech’s promise, it remains.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Can you create lyrics for a song
titled "I hate mosquitos, man, they one of the worst things mankind ever
created"?
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Buzzing in my ear, can’t get no sleep,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Tiny vampires, they make my skin
creep.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the night, they come to feast,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>On my blood, these little beasts.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>I hate mosquitos, man, they’re the
worst,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Nature’s curse, a bloodthirsty thirst.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From dusk till dawn, they hunt and
bite,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In this war, there’s no respite.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Swat and slap, but they evade,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the dark, their plans are laid.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Itchy welts, a constant fight,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Mosquitos, man, they ain’t right.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the jungle, in the city,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Their persistence ain’t so pretty.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the tropics to my backyard,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Mosquitos, man, they hit hard.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>I hate mosquitos, man, they’re the
worst,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Nature’s curse, a bloodthirsty thirst.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From dusk till dawn, they hunt and
bite,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In this war, there’s no respite.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>So here’s to nets and sprays and
creams,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>To peaceful nights and mosquito-free
dreams.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>One day we’ll win, and they’ll be
gone,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>But until then, the fight goes on.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>For the same band, create lyrics for a
song "The Racing Makes it Help the Corners of Your Mind"
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the blur of neon lights,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Thoughts are racing through the
nights.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Synapses fire, connections find,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>The racing makes it help the corners
of your mind.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Speeding thoughts, they intertwine,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the maze of space and time.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the chaos, clarity you’ll find,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>The racing makes it help the corners
of your mind.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Ideas flow like rivers wild,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the chaos, you’re beguiled.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Through the storm, a path defined,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>The racing makes it help the corners
of your mind.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the rush, there’s a spark,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>A light that guides you through the
dark.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the frenzy, peace you’ll find,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>The racing makes it help the corners
of your mind.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Speeding thoughts, they intertwine,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the maze of space and time.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the chaos, clarity you’ll find,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>The racing makes it help the corners
of your mind.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the whirlwind, find your place,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>A sanctuary in the race.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Through the noise, a calm you’ll find,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>The racing makes it help the corners
of your mind.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Now we need lyrics for our complex
song, "Don't Fart, it'll Go Right Up My Butthole"
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the tight confines of this space,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>A delicate dance, a careful pace.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Pressure builds, a silent plea,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Hold it in, don’t set it free.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Don’t fart, it’ll go right up my
butthole,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In this close proximity, we lose
control.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>A gaseous escape, a risky toll,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Don’t fart, it’ll go right up my
butthole.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the car, on a crowded train,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>A moment’s lapse, a world of pain.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Silent but deadly, a stealthy foe,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Hold your breath, let it go.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the realm of social grace,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>We navigate this awkward space.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>A symphony of silent woes,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the air, the tension grows.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Don’t fart, it’ll go right up my
butthole,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In this close proximity, we lose
control.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>A gaseous escape, a risky toll,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Don’t fart, it’ll go right up my
butthole.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>So here’s to holding tight and true,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the moments shared by me and you.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>A laugh, a joke, a tale untold,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Don’t fart, it’ll go right up my
butthole.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>And finally, we need lyrics for our
final most epic song, "Sing in Seven Languages". Be sure to make it
related to biotech.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the lab where dreams ignite,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Genes and codes, we rewrite.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the helix to the stars,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Biotech’s reach, it knows no bars.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Sing in seven languages, let the world
unite,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the code of life, we find our
light.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the smallest cell to the vast
unknown,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Biotech’s seeds are sown.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>CRISPR cuts and splices fate,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Nature’s laws we now debate.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Synthetic cells, a new creation,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Life’s blueprint, our own narration.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the dance of genes, we find our
place,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>A universal song, a cosmic race.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the petri dish to the stars
above,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Biotech’s promise, a labor of love.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Sing in seven languages, let the world
unite,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the code of life, we find our
light.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the smallest cell to the vast
unknown,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Biotech’s seeds are sown.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In every culture, in every land,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Biotech’s touch, a guiding hand.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the ancient scripts to the modern
day,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In seven tongues, we find our way.
<br />

<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>So sing in seven languages, let the
chorus rise,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>In the symphony of life, we harmonize.
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>From the lab to the stars, our voices
blend,
<span data-indentlevel="2"></span>Biotech’s journey, it has no end.
