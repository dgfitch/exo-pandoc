  lyrics:
    My math rock band needs lyrics for our concept album about biotechnology. Some good lyrics for a song entitled "The Sky is Unclassified in Most Locations" are:

    In the lab where secrets grow,
    Genes and codes, the future’s show.
    Microscopes and petri dreams,
    Life’s rewritten, or so it seems.

    The sky is unclassified in most locations,
    Boundless as our DNA’s mutations.
    From the petri dish to the stars,
    Biotech’s reach, it knows no bars.

    CRISPR cuts and splices fate,
    Nature’s laws we now debate.
    Synthetic cells, a new creation,
    Life’s blueprint, our own narration.

    In the helix, we find our place,
    A dance of genes, a cosmic race.
    From the smallest cell to the vast unknown,
    Biotech’s seeds are sown.

    The sky is unclassified in most locations,
    Boundless as our DNA’s mutations.
    From the petri dish to the stars,
    Biotech’s reach, it knows no bars.

    In every code, a story lies,
    Of human dreams and boundless skies.
    The future’s here, in strands and chains,
    Biotech’s promise, it remains.

    Can you create lyrics for a song titled "I hate mosquitos, man, they one of the worst things mankind ever created"?

    Buzzing in my ear, can’t get no sleep,
    Tiny vampires, they make my skin creep.
    In the night, they come to feast,
    On my blood, these little beasts.

    I hate mosquitos, man, they’re the worst,
    Nature’s curse, a bloodthirsty thirst.
    From dusk till dawn, they hunt and bite,
    In this war, there’s no respite.

    Swat and slap, but they evade,
    In the dark, their plans are laid.
    Itchy welts, a constant fight,
    Mosquitos, man, they ain’t right.

    In the jungle, in the city,
    Their persistence ain’t so pretty.
    From the tropics to my backyard,
    Mosquitos, man, they hit hard.

    I hate mosquitos, man, they’re the worst,
    Nature’s curse, a bloodthirsty thirst.
    From dusk till dawn, they hunt and bite,
    In this war, there’s no respite.

    So here’s to nets and sprays and creams,
    To peaceful nights and mosquito-free dreams.
    One day we’ll win, and they’ll be gone,
    But until then, the fight goes on.

    For the same band, create lyrics for a song "The Racing Makes it Help the Corners of Your Mind"

    In the blur of neon lights,
    Thoughts are racing through the nights.
    Synapses fire, connections find,
    The racing makes it help the corners of your mind.

    Speeding thoughts, they intertwine,
    In the maze of space and time.
    From the chaos, clarity you’ll find,
    The racing makes it help the corners of your mind.

    Ideas flow like rivers wild,
    In the chaos, you’re beguiled.
    Through the storm, a path defined,
    The racing makes it help the corners of your mind.

    In the rush, there’s a spark,
    A light that guides you through the dark.
    From the frenzy, peace you’ll find,
    The racing makes it help the corners of your mind.

    Speeding thoughts, they intertwine,
    In the maze of space and time.
    From the chaos, clarity you’ll find,
    The racing makes it help the corners of your mind.

    In the whirlwind, find your place,
    A sanctuary in the race.
    Through the noise, a calm you’ll find,
    The racing makes it help the corners of your mind.

    Now we need lyrics for our complex song, "Don't Fart, it'll Go Right Up My Butthole"

    In the tight confines of this space,
    A delicate dance, a careful pace.
    Pressure builds, a silent plea,
    Hold it in, don’t set it free.

    Don’t fart, it’ll go right up my butthole,
    In this close proximity, we lose control.
    A gaseous escape, a risky toll,
    Don’t fart, it’ll go right up my butthole.

    In the car, on a crowded train,
    A moment’s lapse, a world of pain.
    Silent but deadly, a stealthy foe,
    Hold your breath, let it go.

    In the realm of social grace,
    We navigate this awkward space.
    A symphony of silent woes,
    In the air, the tension grows.

    Don’t fart, it’ll go right up my butthole,
    In this close proximity, we lose control.
    A gaseous escape, a risky toll,
    Don’t fart, it’ll go right up my butthole.

    So here’s to holding tight and true,
    In the moments shared by me and you.
    A laugh, a joke, a tale untold,
    Don’t fart, it’ll go right up my butthole.

    And finally, we need lyrics for our final most epic song, "Sing in Seven Languages". Be sure to make it related to biotech.

    In the lab where dreams ignite,
    Genes and codes, we rewrite.
    From the helix to the stars,
    Biotech’s reach, it knows no bars.

    Sing in seven languages, let the world unite,
    In the code of life, we find our light.
    From the smallest cell to the vast unknown,
    Biotech’s seeds are sown.

    CRISPR cuts and splices fate,
    Nature’s laws we now debate.
    Synthetic cells, a new creation,
    Life’s blueprint, our own narration.

    In the dance of genes, we find our place,
    A universal song, a cosmic race.
    From the petri dish to the stars above,
    Biotech’s promise, a labor of love.

    Sing in seven languages, let the world unite,
    In the code of life, we find our light.
    From the smallest cell to the vast unknown,
    Biotech’s seeds are sown.

    In every culture, in every land,
    Biotech’s touch, a guiding hand.
    From the ancient scripts to the modern day,
    In seven tongues, we find our way.

    So sing in seven languages, let the chorus rise,
    In the symphony of life, we harmonize.
    From the lab to the stars, our voices blend,
    Biotech’s journey, it has no end.

    using Mogwai - Ritchie Sacramento for all tracks is pretty great...

    1 is kind of upbeat snappy
      Ceiling Granny
    2 is kind of doomy riffy, fast building end
      Drive the Nail
    3 is kind of waltzy plaintive
      Pat Stains
    4 (mislabeled in some releases) is all over the map, starts doomy and goes mathy
      Ritchie Sacramento
      Supposedly, We Were Nightmares
    5 is spacey hopeful
      To the Bin My Friend
      It's What I Want to Do, Mum
